console.log("hello we are on");

//objects - complex data type 
const person ={
    myname:"vivekKumar",
    age:18,
};
console.log(person);
console.log(typeof person);
console.log(person.age);
console.log(person.myname);


//arrays in js 
let arr=[2,4,5,6,78,9,9];
console.log(arr);
console.log(typeof arr);


//date
const date =new Date();
console.log(date);

//last but not the least 
//js is a dynamically typed language which means at one time a variable conatining number can be convertd into a string 

let a=8;
console.log(a);
a="hello number now you are a string ";
console.log(a);
//this is a major disadvantage for js , as the data type of a variable can change anytime
